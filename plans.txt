BIG IDEA:
HBUpdater moves to a form where the pages are generated from data in each repolist, move the repolists to a more complex form like

[
	"games" : {
	 	"title" : "Games",
	 	"desciption" : "Homebrew games, ports, and engines",
	 	"details" : "Pretend I've written a longer description about what games are",
	 	"packages" : [
	 		{

Todo:
Change HBUpdater functionality of findasset() to take args in the form:
[[[fp1,fp2,...], lp], [[fpA], lpA],...]

change store_equivalent to package

Todo:
add *instant* check-for-update (interaction between HBUpdater, parser, and etagging)
